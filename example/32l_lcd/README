    From Flash: working
    From SRAM: doutbful...

This displays "on" then "off" on the LCD, while the green and blue LEDs
alternate.  The LEDs alternate to help you differentiate this example from
32l_dac, which blinks the two LEDs in time.

This will run from flash by default, which has been verified to work.  Running
from SRAM allegedly works, but is not fully tested.
